Analyze the use of intermediate layer representations of the Neural Network in identifying adversarial attacks using [Deep kNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04765) method when applied to poisoned models and whether we can detect adversarial examples that are engineered using [ILA](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Huang_Enhancing_Adversarial_Example_Transferability_With_an_Intermediate_Level_Attack_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)_
